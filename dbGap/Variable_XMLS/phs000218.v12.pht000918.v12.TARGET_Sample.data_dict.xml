Samples are the final preps submitted for genotyping, sequencing, and/or expression data. For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs. The data table also includes a mapping of sample IDs to other sample ID aliases, and the study/substudy (phs accession) that the sample belongs to. The substudies are: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Pilot Phase 1 (ALLP1), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Expansion Phase 2 (ALLP2), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Acute Myeloid Leukemia Induction Failure Subproject (AML-IF), Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney (CCSK), Neuroblastoma (NBL), Osteosarcoma (OS), Model Systems (MDLS): Cell Lines and Xenografts (including PPTP), Rhabdoid Tumor (RT) and Wilms' Tumor (WT). The subject sample mapping file also includes sample use.</description><variable id="phv00076499.v12"><name>SUBJID</name><description>TARGET subject id</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00076500.v12"><name>SAMPLENAME</name><description>Sample name</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00162689.v11"><name>SAMPLE_SOURCE</name><description>Sample source</description><type>string</type><value>NCI_TARGET</value></variable><variable id="phv00162690.v11"><name>SOURCE_SAMPID</name><description>Source sample Id</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00167557.v9"><name>STUDY</name><description>DbGaP top-level study or substudy accession</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00201795.v2"><name>SAMPLE_USE</name><description>Sample use.
