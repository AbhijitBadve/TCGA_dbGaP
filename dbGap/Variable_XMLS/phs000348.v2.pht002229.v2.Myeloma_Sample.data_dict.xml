For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs.</description><variable id="phv00159444.v2"><name>SUBJID</name><description>Subject ID</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00159445.v2"><name>SAMPID</name><description>Sample ID</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00201406.v1"><name>SAMPLE_USE</name><description>Data Types generated for sample.
