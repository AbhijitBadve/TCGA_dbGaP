Samples are the final preps submitted for genotyping, sequencing, and/or expression data. For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs. The data table also includes sample use.</description><variable id="phv00200347.v2"><name>SUBJID</name><description>De-identified Subject ID</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00200348.v2"><name>SAMPID</name><description>De-identified Sample ID</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00200349.v2"><name>SAMPLE_USE</name><description>Use of samples.
