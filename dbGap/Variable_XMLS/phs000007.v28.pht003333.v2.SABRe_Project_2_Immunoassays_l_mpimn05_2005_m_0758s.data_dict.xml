This is the fifth in a series of immunoassay panels done on the same group of participants (Offspring Exam 7 and Gen 3 Exam 1). To get a full set of all the immunoassays done, please combine the following datasets: l_mpimn01_2005_m_0692s, l_mpimn02_2005_m_0693s, l_mpimn03_2005_m_0694s, l_mpimn04_2005_m_0757s, l_mpimn05_2005_m_0758s, l_mpimn06_2005_m_0792s, l_mpimn07_2005_m_0802s, and l_mpimn08_2005_m_0836s.</description><variable id="phv00190956.v2"><name>shareid</name><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><type/></variable><variable id="phv00190957.v2"><name>plate_id</name><description>ID number of plate</description><type/><comment>Character field
