Samples are the final preps submitted for genotyping, sequencing, and/or expression data. For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs. This table also includes sample use.</description><variable id="phv00169058.v5"><name>SUBJID</name><description>Subject ID, GTEx Public Donor ID</description><type/></variable><variable id="phv00169059.v5"><name>SAMPID</name><description>Sample ID, GTEx Public Sample ID</description><type/></variable><variable id="phv00169060.v5"><name>SAMPLE_USE</name><description>Sample Use.
