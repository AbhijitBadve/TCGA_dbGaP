The purpose of this study is to identify genetic variation in the normal human population that is associated with variation in sleep spindle characteristics. In order to estimate sleep spindle activity in individuals from the FHS, a power spectral analysis was performed on epochs that were scored as stage 2 sleep. All FHS subjects with nocturnal polysomnography data including EEG polysomnogram were included. For subjects with multiple polysomnograms, only the first polysomnogram was used.</description><variable id="phv00190762.v2"><name>shareid</name><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><type/></variable><variable id="phv00190763.v2"><name>mean_Sigma_S2</name><description>Mean absolute Sigma power in stage 2 sleep</description><type/><unit>uV^2</unit><logical_min>1.89438</logical_min><logical_max>1258.9925</logical_max></variable><variable id="phv00190764.v2"><name>idtype</name><description>Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier</description><type/><value code="0">Original Cohort</value><value code="1">Offspring Cohort</value><value code="7">Omni 1 Cohort</value></variable><variable id="phv00190765.v2"><name>stdydtqa</name><description>PSG study date</description><type/><unit>days</unit><logical_min>7841</logical_min><logical_max>17324</logical_max><comment>Number of days since Exam 1</comment></variable></data_table>
