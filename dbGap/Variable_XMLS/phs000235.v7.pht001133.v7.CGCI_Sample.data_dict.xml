Samples are the final preps submitted for sequencing. For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs. The data table also includes sample use and a STUDY variable that lists the substudy accessions. The substudies are Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP), HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project - Cervical Cancer (HTMCP - CC), HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project - Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (HTMCP - DLBCL), HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project - Lung Cancer (HTMCP - LC), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma - Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (NHL - DLBCL), and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma - Follicular Lymphoma (NHL - FL). There are 2 other substudies for which there are no samples at this time. They are the Medulloblastoma (MB) and Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) Grants - RC1 Human Lung Carcinogenesis substudies.</description><variable id="phv00088040.v7"><name>SUBJID</name><description>Subject Id</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00088041.v7"><name>SAMPLENAME</name><description>Sample Name</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00173787.v4"><name>STUDY</name><description>Study cohort and dbGaP substudy accession</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00224921.v1"><name>SAMPLE_USE</name><description>Sample use.
