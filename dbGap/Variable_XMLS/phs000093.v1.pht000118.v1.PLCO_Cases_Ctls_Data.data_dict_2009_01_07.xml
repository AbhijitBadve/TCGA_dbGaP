	<description>Cumulative number of Pack-Years smoked</description>
	<comment>
		Cumulative quantity of Pack-Years, calculated as Pack/day*years, where 1 pack=20 cigarettes. The questionnaire asks for age started (Q11) and age stopped (Q13) smoking and the category of cigarettes smoked per day (1-10, 11-20, etc-Q14). The number of packs per day is based on the midpoint of the range of cigarettes smoked per day. Pack years are derived by multiplying packs per day times duration.
