This is the sixth in a series of immunoassay panels done on the same group of participants (Offspring Exam 7 and Gen 3 Exam 1). To get a full set of all the immunoassays done, please combine the following datasets: l_mpimn01_2005_m_0692s, l_mpimn02_2005_m_0693s, l_mpimn03_2005_m_0694s, l_mpimn04_2005_m_0757s, l_mpimn05_2005_m_0758s, l_mpimn06_2005_m_0792s, l_mpimn07_2005_m_0802s, and l_mpimn08_2005_m_0836s.</description><variable id="phv00201452.v2"><name>shareid</name><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><type/></variable><variable id="phv00201453.v2"><name>plate_id</name><description>ID number of plate</description><type/><comment>Character field

		This apolipoprotein B assay is the same as the one done in panel I (dataset name: l_mpimn01_2005_m_0692).  This time the dilution was lower so that fewer would be below the detectable limit.  This apolipoprotein B variable should be used instead of the APO_B100 variable in the panel I dataset. </comment><value code=".">Unknown</value></variable><variable id="phv00201459.v2"><name>apob_cv</name><description>CV for apolipoprotein B</description><type/><logical_min>0</logical_min><logical_max>33.4</logical_max><comment>APOB_CV values were set to unknown if APOB_CV was greater than or equal to 27.1 for Offspring (IDTYPE = 1) or 34.2 for Gen 3 (IDTYPE = 3).</comment><value code=".">Unknown</value></variable><variable id="phv00201460.v2"><name>Adipsin</name><description>Adipsin</description><type/><unit>pg/mL</unit><logical_min>18600</logical_min><logical_max>7450000</logical_max><comment>The lower detectable limit for ADIPSIN is 4480 pg/mL and the upper detectable limit is 18300000 pg/mL.
