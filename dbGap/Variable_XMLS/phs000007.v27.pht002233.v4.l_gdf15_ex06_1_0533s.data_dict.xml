GDF-15 is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta family, originally known as macrophage-inhibitory cytokine 1. Expression of GDF-15 is strongly induced in cardiomyocytes by pressure overload, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Predictably, GDF-15 is markedly elevated in animal models of cardiomyopathy. GDF-15 has anti-hypertrophic, anti-apoptic, and anti-remodeling properties, and thus appears to play a protective role in vivo. In animal models, genetic suppression of GDF-15 leads to excessive cardiac hypertrophy. Conversely, stimulation of GDF-15 attenuates cardiac hypertrophy. Samples were collected from citrated plasma.</description><variable id="phv00159491.v4"><name>shareid</name><description>Framingham Heart Study participant SHARe ID number</description><type/></variable><variable id="phv00159492.v4"><name>gdf15</name><description>Growth differentiation factor-15 (sample: citrated plasma)</description><type>integer</type><unit>ng/L</unit><logical_min>306</logical_min><logical_max>16074</logical_max></variable><variable id="phv00159493.v4"><name>IDTYPE</name><description>Framingham Heart Study cohort group</description><type>encoded</type><value code="1">Offspring Cohort</value></variable></data_table>
