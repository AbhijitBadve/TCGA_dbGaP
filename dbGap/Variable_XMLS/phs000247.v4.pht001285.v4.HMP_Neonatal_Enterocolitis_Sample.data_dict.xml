Samples are the final preps submitted for sequencing. For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs. Also included is sample use.</description><variable id="phv00091255.v4"><name>SUBJID</name><description>Subject ID Randomly generated IDS</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00091256.v4"><name>SAMPID</name><description>Sample ID - ID associated with DNA sequence (at WashU - Matrix ID)</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00193865.v2"><name>SAMPLE_USE</name><description>Use of Sample.
