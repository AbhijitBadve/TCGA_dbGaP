	<type>integer</type>
	<comment>For MGS1, this is always definite or &quot;2&quot;, because all probands had at least 1 full or half sibling or parent with a consensus diagnosis of SZ or SZ by direct interview and full consensus diagnostic procedure. For MGS2,  the maximum rating was 1, indicating a suspicion of psychotic disorder based on family history information: diagnosticians arrived at consensus ratings of first- or second-degree relatives based on family history information only, either from the proband or from a family informant, with this variable = &quot;Y&quot; if the consensus for at least one such relative was &quot;2&quot; (likely, present) or &quot;3&quot; (definite) that some psychotic disorder was present, regardless of the most likely DSM diagnosis for the psychosis.  Thus for MGS2, a rating here of &quot;0&quot; simply means that no positive information was obtained to suggest a probably positive FH, and this cannot be interpreted as absence of family history.</comment>
