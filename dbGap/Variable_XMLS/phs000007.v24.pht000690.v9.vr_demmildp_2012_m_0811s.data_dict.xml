Variables includes dementia status (at least mild), dementia subtype (classified with Alzheimer's disease and stroke), date known to be cognitively intact and date of incident dementia, death or censoring. Dementia was defined using DSM-IV criteria. The Epidemiology of Dementia Study has tracked incident cases of dementia in the Framingham cohort. Although not formally initiated until 1986, the initial baseline dementia-free Original cohort was determined from 1976-1978. Tracking for incident dementia in the Offspring cohort also began in 1976 and subjects have had serial MMSE since 1991. Participants whose performance on the MMSE drops 5 or more points across multiple examinations or 3 or more points from the previous examination or who are referred b themselves, their family, a physician from the community or from a FHS ancillary study examination, are flagged for a follow-up neurological and neuropsychological evaluation. Those found to be cognitive impaired by either evaluation are brought to a diagnostic consensus meeting to determine if dementia is evident, and if so, what subtype. Additional information about disease progression (when applicable) is also recorded.</description><variable id="phv00069844.v8"><name>shareid</name><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><type/></variable><variable id="phv00069840.v8"><name>type</name><description>Dementia subtype</description><type/><comment>Blank = Dementia status, at least mild = No</comment><value code="AD_STR">Alzheimer's disease with stroke</value><value code="AD_VaD">Mixed dementia: Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia</value><value code="AD_noSTR">Alzheimer's disease without stroke</value><value code="VaD_noAD">Vascular dementia with no Alzheimer's disease</value><value code="other">Neither Alzheimer's disease nor vascular dementia</value></variable><variable id="phv00069839.v8"><name>mildDEM_status</name><description>Dementia status, at least mild</description><type/><value code="0">No</value><value code="1">Yes</value><value code=".">Unknown</value></variable><variable id="phv00069841.v8"><name>idtype</name><description>Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier</description><type/><value code="0">Original Cohort</value><value code="1">Offspring Cohort</value></variable><variable id="phv00089374.v7"><name>entry_date</name><description>Date of entry into the "Dementia Mild Plus Incidence" cohort</description><type/><unit>days since exam 1</unit><logical_min>2016</logical_min><logical_max>10698</logical_max><comment>ENTRY_DATE is formatted MMDDYYYY.
