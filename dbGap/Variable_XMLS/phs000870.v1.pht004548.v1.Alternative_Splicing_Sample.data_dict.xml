For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs. The data table also includes sample use.</description><variable id="phv00224895.v1"><name>SUBJECT_ID</name><description>Subject ID</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00224896.v1"><name>SAMPLE_ID</name><description>Sample ID</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00224897.v1"><name>SAMPLE_USE</name><description>Sample Use</description><type>encoded values</type><value code="Seq_DNA_WholeExome">Whole exome sequencing</value><value code="Seq_DNA_WholeGenome">Whole genome sequencing</value><value code="Seq_RNA_WTSS">Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq)</value><value code="Seq_miRNA">Sequencing of microRNA</value></variable></data_table>
