One of the two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the presence of amyloid-containing senile plaques; a key component of these plaques is insoluble forms of the beta-amyloid (AB) protein, specifically AB1-42 and AB1-40. Plasma concentrations of AB1-42 and AB1-40 levels were measured using a fluorimetric immunoassay, to evaluate the clinical correlates, and to assess the prognostic significance in AD and its precursor, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The limit of detection for this assay is 12pg/ml for AB1-40 and 5pg/ml for AB1-42. All assays were run on a single lot.</description><variable id="phv00219222.v2"><name>shareid</name><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><type/></variable><variable id="phv00219223.v2"><name>AB40</name><description>Beta Amyloid 40</description><type/><unit>pg/mL</unit><logical_min>19.9</logical_min><logical_max>1329.7</logical_max><value code=".">Unknown</value></variable><variable id="phv00219224.v2"><name>AB42</name><description>Beta Amyloid 42</description><type/><unit>pg/mL</unit><logical_min>4</logical_min><logical_max>116.3</logical_max><comment>The lower limit of this assay is 4 pg/ml. If AB42 was below this limit, AB42 was set to 4 pg/ml and AB42_I was set to 1.
