The questionnaire asks for age started (Q11) and age stopped (Q13) smoking and the category of cigarettes smoked per day (1-10, 11-20, etc-Q14). The number of packs per day is based on the midpoint of the range of cigarettes smoked per day. Pack years are derived by multiplying packs per day times duration.
